Personal Snoezelen Device for dementia patients

## About the project

The idea for the project consists of applying the concept of Snoezelen chambers to treat dementia patients at home with a device.

A Snoezelen chamber is a therapeutic space designed to provide a controlled and calming environment for individuals with sensory processing difficulties or developmental disabilities. Equipped with various sensory elements such as specialized lighting, sounds, tactile objects, and visual displays, the Snoezelen chamber aims to stimulate the senses and promote relaxation, exploration, and sensory integration. It is commonly used in healthcare, educational, and care settings to reduce anxiety, improve mood, enhance sensory awareness, and support self-regulation.

To bring the experience of a Snoezelen chamber to home was the main idea behihd the project. In order to accomplish the goal, a device was needed.
The device was equipped with speakers, leds, and a vapor generator. This actuators will work randomly to cautivate the attention of the patient.

Because the device its for home use, it was mandatory to find a case to disguise all its components, something that can easily past as something that can be found in anormal house, at any room.In many rooms what is very commom to find is a vase, which perfectly fits with the purpose of our project, because it can contain liquid which is necessary for the vapor generator and also can contain the speakers, the ultrasonic sensor and the RGB leds.

## Parts

The device consists of a an array of RGB LEDS that can produce over 16 million hues of light. This can caught the atention of the patient keeping him safe from selfdamage or with any other objects in the room.
It also has two speakers which reproduce music according to the patient needs to calm and relax. Finally there is a vapor generator which produces certain type of essences to create a unique calm atmosphere. 

To initiate the actuators, there is an ultrasonic sensor when someone approaches the device. 

All the acutators and sensors are connected to a Arduino One microcontroller.

First everything wwas setup in a cage and tested before the vase model was 3d printed

The simple first prototype was released:

## Design and making process of personal snoezelen.

Visual effect: We used projector mood light to give visual effects effectively. One is a blue projector which fills the room with blue wave light. Other one is a film projector which can change the colors and the shapes. This two light projectors can stimulate the sense of visuality and make patients more calm.

Sound effect: We used blue tooth speaker to play snoezelen music. We considered about the playlist of music. Mostly, the snoezelen music was europian therapy music. 5So, for Korean patients we knew that traditional folk song based music is more effective for music therapy.

Smell effect: We used aroma oil diffuser to make smell effects. We tried to contain various kinds of smell for manipulation. We designed a multi diffuser for solving the problem.

Tactile sense effect: we used wind processor and humidifier to make tactile stimulation. If the patients go closer with their hands to the device, the device recognize their distance which can make appropriate response like blowing wind and make moisture effects. We 
used ultrasonic sensor for the detection. 


Tactile and Sound effects on tablet pc interface: We tried to give as many stimulation as possible. We added some effects while the patients touch the screen for manipulation. When they touch the bubbles, it vibrates and make different sounds

The functioning begins with ultrasonic sensor that once the patient its detected, randomly selects from the three components mentioned before.The RGB leds display unique colors in certain patterns simulateing the Snoezelezen chambers light.The speakers play calm sounds related to nature like, like wind,waterfall,forest and ocean.Finally the vapor generator located in a small pool filled with water and an essence is ready to produce fragrance with therapeutic properties.
