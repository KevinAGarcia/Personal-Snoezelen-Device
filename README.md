# Personal-Snoezelen-Device
Personal Snoezelen Device for dementia patients

## About the project

![Screen Shot](images/screenshot.png)

The idea for the project consists of applying the concept of Snoezelen chambers to treat dementia patients at home with a device.

A Snoezelen chamber is a therapeutic space designed to provide a controlled and calming environment for individuals with sensory processing difficulties or developmental disabilities. Equipped with various sensory elements such as specialized lighting, sounds, tactile objects, and visual displays, the Snoezelen chamber aims to stimulate the senses and promote relaxation, exploration, and sensory integration. It is commonly used in healthcare, educational, and care settings to reduce anxiety, improve mood, enhance sensory awareness, and support self-regulation.

To bring the experience of a Snoezelen chamber to home was the main idea behihd the project. In order to accomplish the goal, a device was needed.
The device was equipped with speakers, leds, and a vapor generator. This actuators will work randomly to cautivate the attention of the patient.


## Parts

The device consists of a an array of RGB LEDS that can produce over 16 million hues of light. This can caught the atention of the patient keeping him safe from selfdamage or with any other objects in the room.
It also has two speakers which reproduce music according to the patient needs to calm and relax. Finally there is a vapor generator which produces certain type of essences to create a unique calm atmosphere. 

To initiate the actuators, there is an ultrasonic sensor when someone approaches the device. 

All the acutators and sensors are connected to a Arduino One microcontroller.
## Functioning 

The functioning begins with ultrasonic sensor that once the patient its detected, randomly selects from the three components mentioned before.The RGB leds display unique colors in certain patterns simulateing the Snoezelezen chambers light.The speakers play calm sounds related to nature like, like wind,waterfall,forest and ocean.Finally the vapor generator located in a small pool filled with water and an essence is ready to produce fragrance with therapeutic properties.
