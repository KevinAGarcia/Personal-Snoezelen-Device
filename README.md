Personal Snoezelen Device for dementia patients

## About the project

The idea for the project consists of applying the concept of Snoezelen chambers to treat dementia patients at home with a device.

A Snoezelen chamber is a therapeutic space designed to provide a controlled and calming environment for individuals with sensory processing difficulties or developmental disabilities. Equipped with various sensory elements such as specialized lighting, sounds, tactile objects, and visual displays, the Snoezelen chamber aims to stimulate the senses and promote relaxation, exploration, and sensory integration. It is commonly used in healthcare, educational, and care settings to reduce anxiety, improve mood, enhance sensory awareness, and support self-regulation.

Bringing the experience of a Snoezelen chamber home was the main idea behind the project. To accomplish the goal, a device was needed.
The device was equipped with speakers, LEDs, and a vapor generator. These actuators will work randomly to captivate the attention of the patient.

Because the device is for home use, it was mandatory to find a case to disguise all its components, something that can easily pass as something that can be found in a normal house. In many rooms what is very common to find is a vase, which perfectly fits with the purpose of our project, because it can contain a liquid that is necessary for the vapor generator and also can contain the speakers, the ultrasonic sensor, and the RGB LEDs.

## Parts

The device consists of an array of RGB LEDs that can produce over 16 million hues of light. This can catch the attention of the patient keeping him safe from self-damage or any other objects in the room.

It also has two speakers which reproduce music according to the patient's needs to calm and relax.

Finally, there is a vapor generator that produces certain types of essences to create a uniquely calm atmosphere.

To initiate the actuators, there is an ultrasonic sensor when someone approaches the device. 

All the actuators and sensors are connected to an Arduino One microcontroller.

First, everything was set up in a cage and tested before the vase model was 3d printed

The first prototype was released:

## Design and making process of personal snoezelen.

Visual effect: We used projector mood light to give visual effects effectively. One is a blue projector that fills the room with blue wave light. Another one is a film projector which can change the colors and the shapes. These two light projectors can stimulate the sense of visuality and make patients more calm.

Sound effect: We used blue tooth speaker to play snoezelen music. We considered the playlist of music. Mostly, the snoezelen music was European therapy music. So, for Korean patients, we knew that traditional folk song-based music is more effective for music therapy.

Smell effect: We used an aroma oil diffuser to make smell effects. We tried to contain various kinds of smell for manipulation. We designed a multi-diffuser for solving the problem.

Tactile sense effect: we used a wind processor and humidifier to make tactile stimulation. If the patients go closer with their hands to the device, the device recognizes their distance which can make appropriate responses like blowing wind and making moisture effects. We 
used an ultrasonic sensor for the detection.

The functioning begins with an ultrasonic sensor that once the patient its detected, randomly selects from the three components mentioned before. The RGB LEDs display unique colors in certain patterns simulating the Snoezelezen chamber's light. The speakers play calm sounds related to nature, like wind, waterfall, forest, and ocean. Finally the vapor generator located in a small pool filled with water and essence is ready to produce fragrance with therapeutic properties.




### Presenting the device first to patients

The presentation was with the prototype to the elders to see if the device caught their attention and if they were able to stay near the vase for a long time.
The results were very promising, all of them were attracted especially by the vapor that combined with the other features, kept them reinforcing their senses which is the main gold of the project. Continious exposure to the device can delay the advance of dementia patients.
