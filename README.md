Personal Snoezelen Device for dementia patients

## About the project

The idea for the project consists of applying the concept of Snoezelen chambers to treat dementia patients at home with a device.

A Snoezelen chamber is a therapeutic space designed to provide a controlled and calming environment for individuals with sensory processing difficulties or developmental disabilities. Equipped with various sensory elements such as specialized lighting, sounds, tactile objects, and visual displays, the Snoezelen chamber aims to stimulate the senses and promote relaxation, exploration, and sensory integration. It is commonly used in healthcare, educational, and care settings to reduce anxiety, improve mood, enhance sensory awareness, and support self-regulation.

Bringing the experience of a Snoezelen chamber home was the main idea behind the project. To accomplish the goal, a device was needed.
The device was equipped with speakers, LEDs, and a vapor generator. These actuators will work randomly to captivate the attention of the patient.

Because the device is for home use, it was mandatory to find a case to disguise all its components, something that can easily pass as something that can be found in a normal house. In many rooms what is very common to find is a vase, which perfectly fits with the purpose of our project, because it can contain a liquid that is necessary for the vapor generator and also can contain the speakers, the ultrasonic sensor, and the RGB LEDs.

## Parts

The device consists of an array of RGB LEDs that can produce over 16 million hues of light. This can catch the attention of the patient keeping him safe from self-damage or any other objects in the room.

It also has two speakers which reproduce music according to the patient's needs to calm and relax.

Finally, there is a vapor generator that produces certain types of essences to create a uniquely calm atmosphere.

To initiate the actuators, there is an ultrasonic sensor when someone approaches the device. 

All the actuators and sensors are connected to an Arduino One microcontroller.

First, everything was set up in a cage and tested before the vase model was 3d printed

The first prototype was released:

## Design and making process of personal snoezelen.

Visual effect: The RGB LEDs positioned on top of the vase, were at an angle that can reflect several colors in a room, and 
they are one of the first things that can catch the attention of anyone. 
These LEDs can stimulate the sense of visuality and make patients more calm with a combination that best fits the patient.

Sound effect:  Two speakers were used to play Snoezelen music. Mostly, the Snoezelen music was European therapy music. 
So, for Korean patients, traditional folk song-based music is more effective for music therapy.

Smell effect: A vapor generator was used to make smell effects. Various kinds of smells can be applied depending on the patient's needs. 
A multi-diffuser is set to be a future update for the project.

The functioning begins with an ultrasonic sensor that once the patient is detected, randomly selects from the three components mentioned before.
The RGB LEDs display unique colors in certain patterns simulating the Snoezelezen chamber's light. 
The speakers play calm sounds related to nature, like wind, waterfall, forest, and ocean. 
Finally, the vapor generator located in a small pool filled with water and essence is ready to produce fragrance with therapeutic properties.




### Presenting the device first to patients

The presentation was with the prototype to the elders to see if the device caught their attention and if they were able to stay near the vase for a long time.
The results were very promising, all of them were attracted especially by the vapor that combined with the other features, kept them reinforcing their senses which is the main gold of the project. Continuous exposure to the device can delay the advance of dementia patients.

Then, all the actuators and the ultrasonic sensor were located inside the vase, which can be shown in the following animation:

## Future upgrades

For future upgrades, a multiple aroma diffuser would be added. Also, the vase is going to be controlled with an app to enhance and supervise the patient. 
Finally, the Arduino UNO is going to be replaced by a more modern microcontroller that has wifi incorporated and a USB type-C input.
